   *@class  Atom  Atom.h
   *@brief Base class of all other classes that is meant to be managed by 'BaseLibrary'
   *@details  'Atom' will have a few important virtual methods that all derived classes will be
   *          required to implement.  This will allow for the smooth functioning of XML
   *          file reading and writing.  Ex: 'WriteXML',  this method is to write a XML version
   *          of the derived class to a output stream.  A registered BuildFromXML function will
   *          be able to create a new instance of the derived class.
   *
   *          Create on 2010-02-22;  primary purpose is to help generate more ideas along these
   *          lines.
