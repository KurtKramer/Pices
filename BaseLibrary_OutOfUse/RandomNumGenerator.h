   *@brief  Represents one single random number generator.
   *@details  Rather than using the two global functions "lrand48" and "srand48" you can create an
   *          instance of this class that will provide the random sequence. The advantage is that
   *          you can control who has access to this sequence. That is you do not need to worry that
   *          some other code that you are calling is not also getting numbers from this sequence.
   *          This will allow you to guarantee the same sequence of numbers for the same seed.
