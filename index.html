<p>Pices is a Software application for the management of plankton images collected by the SIPPER underwater imaging platform.  The software was developed as part of my graduate studies at the University of South Florida.  The implementation was done in c++ and c#.  The bulk of the processing is done in c++ with limited O/S knowledge; that is the code can be compiled in Windows or Linux.  The GUI functionality was written in c# and communicates with the back-end c++ code through a mixed-memory dll(PicesInterface) that wraps the un-managed c++ classes in managed c++/cli classes.  The data is stored in a MySQL database allowing for quick retrieval via various parameters of plankton images.  </p>

<p>Extensive Image-Processing and Machine-Learning techniques were employed allowing for the quick extraction and classification of individual images.  Through the GUI based application, PICES-Commander, a user can quickly easily and quickly browse images from any cruise/ Station/ Deployment specifying various environmental parameters (depth, O^2, etc...) as filtering requirements.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="Introduction"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The Pices system is a set of applications that were developed as part of my Graduate work. I worked cloely with my major professors Dr. Dmitry Goldgof and Dr. Lawrence Hall and Marine Scientist Dr. Andrew Remsen. This work was originally done to process the imagery and instrumentation data collected by the SIPPER imaging platform developed by University of South Florida Marine Science Center of Oceans Technology. It manages data from cruises dating back to 2002 through 2014 and is being updated to work with the latest implementation of SIPPER for future deployments.<br />
</p>
<p>The system consists of several applications and libraries. Most of the code is written in c++ and is meant to be O/S neutral. The GUI functionality is written in .net c#. There is extensive use of Image Processing (IP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques used in the processing of data.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Applications"></a>
Applications</h1>
<p>There are more than 20 applications in the system but only a few comprise the bulk of the functionality</p>
<p>List of some but not all applications:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://kurtkramer.github.io/Pices/Doxygen/html/d7/d53/namespace_pices_commander.html">PicesComander</a> The main GUI application that provides a thumbnail view of collected plankton images; Provides charting functionality, classification processes, reporting facilities allowing user to analyze data by deployments, stations, instrument parameters(O^2, Depth, Salinity, etc...). Other functionality consists of validation of data, updating of training libraries(Active Learning), and reclassification of imagery based off user improved training data. Randomly extract data from deployments for ground-truthing to help gauge classification performance,</li>
<li>WindowsImageExtraction Where raw sipper data is fed into the system; this application extracts imagery, Instrumentation data, computes feature vectors m and performs initial classification that is then fed into the Pices database where the user can then browse the results.</li>
<li>SipperFleViewer - A simple viewer application that allows the user to view the raw sipper data, both imagery and instrumentation data.</li>
<li>GradeTraingModel GUI Tool to grade the different training libraries against user ground truthed data; generates reports where user can select the classification granularity with respect to class hierarchy.</li>
<li>ImportGPS_Data Imports GPS data collected by ship into Pices database.</li>
<li>SpatialAnalysis</li>
<li>CrossValodation</li>
<li>FeatureSelection - Application that will tune SVM parameters and image extracted features to maximize classification accuracy; it was decide to run on a cluster; the more CPU's the faster it processes. It can work in a mixed Windows/linux environment only requiring a common file share device.</li>
<li>SipperInterface GUI Application that is usd to operate the SIPPER III imaging platform.</li>
<li>SipperDiskManager - GUI Application that manages the downloading of data from the SIPPER III Proprietary disk format. The forthcoming SIPPER IV will be using standard linux volumes eliminating the need for this application.</li>
</ul>

Libraries</h1>
<p>There are several libraries that are utilized by the various applications.</p>
<p>List of Libraries:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://kurtkramer.github.io/Pices/Doxygen/html/d4/d25/namespace_k_k_u.html">BaseLibrary</a>(c++) Functionality that is common to other libraries and applications. Some examples includes string management, Matrix operations, Image Processing, Token Parsing, Statistics, Histogramming, and common operating system routines. Most O/S specific code is implemented in the module "osServices.cpp". This is an earlier version of the of the KKBase libray found in "KSquareLibraries".</li>
<li><a href="http://kurtkramer.github.io/Pices/Doxygen/html/d7/d8c/namespace_sipper_hardware.html">SipperIstruments</a>(c++) Classes and functions that ar specific to the SIPPER platform are maintained in this library. Examples are a group of classes meant to process the different SIPPER file formats going back to the original SIPPER I platform.</li>
<li><a href="http://kurtkramer.github.io/Pices/Doxygen/html/d7/dcc/namespace_m_l_l.html">PicesLibary</a>(c++) Classes and Code that support Machine-Learning and specific Pices imaging routines. Other functionality includes MySQL DataBase.<ol type="1">
<li>FeatureFileIO several comman feature data file formats are support. (sparse, arff, c45, etc...)</li>
<li>Training-Model-Configuration class and routines that maintain classifier parameters; such as classifier type.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Classes (MLClass) and containers for tracking lists of classes.</li>
<li>Hierarchial Class naming is supported.</li>
