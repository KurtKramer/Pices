The software was developed as part of my graduate studies at the University of South Florida.  The implementation was done in c++ and c#.  The bulk of the processing is done in c++ with limited O/S knowledge; that is the code can be compiled in Windows or Linux.  The GUI functionality was written in c# and communicates with the back-end c++ code through a mixed-memory dll(PicesInterface) that wraps the un-managed c++ classes in managed c++/cli classes.  The data is stored in a MySQL database allowing for quick retrieval via various parameters of plankton images.  \r\n\r\nExtensive Image-Processing and Machine-Learning techniques were employed allowing for the quick extraction and classification of individual images.  Through the GUI based application, PICES-Commander, a user can quickly easily and quickly browse images from any cruise/ Station/ Deployment specifying various environmental parameters (depth, O^2, etc...) as filtering requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Documentation\r\n[Pices Doxygen Documentation](http://kurtkramer.github.io/Pices/Doxygen/html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
